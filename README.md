# Youtube music web apps.

## Intro

sometimes I just want to listen to audio from youtube and save a list of favorite songs from youtube then listen to them.

This is a simple web apps including audio player and playlist, I use localstorage to save songs to playlist.

The simple usage is to copy the url from a video from youtube then enter in the input box then enjoy.
